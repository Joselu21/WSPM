# WSPM
Web Scraper and Price Monitor (WSPM) is a useful tool made in Python with Selenium that is prepared to scrap webshops with configurable patterns in json format, and can track the prices of the scrapped products. You can configure users to be notified by email when certain products, especified by patterns (e.g RTX 3060 Ti) are below a threshold price
